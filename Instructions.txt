Attached is simple mock-up of a homepage. Can you build out the page in valid HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript using Bootstrap 3. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it does need to look like the mockup. A bonus if it's responsive for mobile / tablet.  Also, please include Angular.js and make something on the page dynamic. It can just pull from a hardcoded object or array.
